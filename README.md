- Check username and password in `app.py`
- Ensure database exists

**Charts Not Displaying:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure Chart.js CDN is accessible

**No Data Showing:**
- Verify sample data was inserted
- Check API endpoints are returning data

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication system
- Export reports to PDF
- Email notifications
- Attendance tracking
- Parent portal
- Mobile app
